Q: Why doesn't my mouse wheel work?
A: Mouse Wheels are only supported by Java Run-Time Environments greater
   than or equal to 1.4.0. Make sure you have installed at least this
   version of a JRE and your mouse wheel should begin to work.

Q: How do I setup my *nix system to use IcyBee without launching from a web
   browser every time?
A: Create a shortcut or script to execute the following command:
    /usr/local/javaws/javaws http://www.nuclearbunny.org/icybee/icybee.jnlp
   Substitute the appropriate path to your javaws executable depending on your
   local installation.

Q: Help! When I click on a URL from within IcyBee, I get an 
   "Unable to Display URL" error. How can I configure Java Web Start to 
   properly integrate with my browser so IcyBee can display URLs?
A: Launch the javaws executable from your installed location. Once it has
   loaded, select the Preferences option from the File menu. In the General
   tab, there is a Browser Setup section where you can type the path to launch
   your browser of choice. The actual layout of the Java Web Start dialogs
   will vary between versions, but they should all be similiar to this
   description.
