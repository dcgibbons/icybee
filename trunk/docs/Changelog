  working.

Version 0.89
------------
* Removed all strings from PropertiesDialog and correctly used the UIMessages class to localize them.

  This allows control-tab to be used to move around the client window without a mouse.
* Added set/get of text encoding property from the advanced configuration panel to restore the
  functionality.
* Created a new AboutDialog to dynamically generate the Help/About dialog. Java information is
  now shown on the dialog for debugging purposes.

* Added Client interface that ICBClient implements to hide implementation details from users
  of client methods

  be sent.

Version 0.87
------------
* Added cicb-compatiable TCL triggers.

Version 0.86
------------
* The color of the caret will now be set to the same color as the foreground

* Added a windowListener for the URL Grabber so that if the window is manually
  closed it will be saved to the client properties.
* Fixed a bug in the DisplayTextPanel so that an initial selection of a text
  property is done whenever the styles are loaded from the PropertiesDialog
  object. This ensures that all of the dialog properties have initial values
  that are correct.
* Added login to reconnect and use the user's alternative nickname if the
  server rejects login with a "nickname already in use" error. The dialog
  to configure the alternative nickname was enabled.
* Fixed a bug that prevented right-click context menus from working properly
  if text was selected right-to-left.
