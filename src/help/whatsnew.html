<center><h1>What's new in IcyBee?</h1></center>

<h2>Version 1.02 - November 8, 2009</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The output of the who listing now allows you to click on nicknames within
        the listing.
    </li>
    <li>The who listing is formatted differently so that proportional fonts can be used
        and the listing will remain align. The message of the day will not appear aligned,
        however.
    </li>
    <li>The seldom-used URL Grabber and Toolbar features are now disabled by default.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 1.01 - January 4, 2009</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Paste Special feature now uses the http://bit.ly/ URL shortening service
        instead of TinyURL. This is a faster service and has a real API, so it should
        hopefully prove to be more stable in the long term.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.0 - January 3, 2009</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Java Run-Time Version 1.6 is now preferred, with 1.5 as a minimum
        requirement. This will provide a more robust run-time environment with
        fewer bugs than the default 1.4 environment before.
    </li>
    <li>Several bugs with connection timeouts have been fixed.</li>
    <li>IcyBee finally hits 1.0 after over 4 years in 'alpha' testing :-)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.92 - September 19, 2004</h2>
<ul>
    <li>File Logging now honors the message timestamp feature.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug where newlines were removed instead of being converted
        to spaces. This should allow pastes of large amounts of text to
        be easier to read.
    </li>
    <li>Added a Paste Special command that will attempt to shrink any
        valid URLs found in the clipboard text being pasted. Currently,
        the <a href="http://tinyurl.com">TinyURL</a> service is used
        to shrink the URLs. Paste Special has a keyboard shortcut of
        Press Shift when performing a normal Paste to activate this
        feature. <b>Warning:</b> presently, there is no way to cancel
        or to adjust the timeout value, so if TinyURL is slow, the client
        will wait a bit before giving up. This will be addressed in
        a future version.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.91 - June 8, 2004</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Updated required minimum JRE to V1.4 in order to avoid many JRE bugs.</li>
    <li>Improved integration with Mac OS X</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.90 - November 11, 2003</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug that prevented the ability to select text in the output window.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.89 - October 23, 2003</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added input history support. The up arrow and down arrow will move through the
        history list, depending on if the caret position is at the start or end of the
        input buffer.
    </li>
    <li>Fixed focus issues so that control-tab will correctly move between components
        on the screen. This allows the user to move between components without using
        the mouse.
    </li>
    <li>Updated the Help/About dialog to display Java Run-Time environment information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.88 - August 14, 2003</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added log, c_log Tcl commands to toggle logging. c_log takes an optional log file that
        will be used instead of the log file name currently configured in IcyBee's properties.
    </li>
    <li>Changed the tab history so that it should respond more naturally when used.</li>
    <li>Added c_hdel to remove a specific user from the tab history, and c_hclear to clear the
        entire tab history.
    </li>
    <li>Changed the properties dialog so that all of the property panels will be sized together in a
        more natural way.
    </li>
    <li>Fixed the /write command so that extremely long messages can be sent without error. The client
        will correctly split up the message into multiple packets for the server to handle correct.
    </li>
    <li>Newlines are now changed to spaces on input instead of being simply removed. This allows a paste
        of content to be formatted more naturally when it is sent.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.87 - March 30, 2003</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added cicb-compatiable TCL triggers: Trig_openmsg, Trig_personalmsg, Trig_arrivemsg, Trig_leavemsg,
        Trig_bootmsg, Trig_dropmsg, Trig_errormsg, Trig_importantmsg, Trig_invitemsg
    </li>
    <li>
    <li>Fixed a bug that caused IcyBee to appear to hang and stop displaying any output.</li>
    <li>Changed the devil emoticon from >:) to }:) yet again.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.86 - March 28, 2003</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The color of the caret in the input window will now match the foreground color of
        the text. This allows the caret to be visible even if the background is changed to
        black.
    </li>
    <li>The URL Grabber window will now stay closed if you close the window with the window
        decorations (the "X" box) instead of using the View menu.
    </li>
    <li>The Display/Text dialog will properly default to one of the text selection items so
        that all buttons work and all values are correct.
    </li>
    <li>Enabled the configuration of an alternative nickname. If the client detects that the
        server disconnected you because your primary nickname was already in use, it will
        retry once with the alternative nickname.
    </li>
    <li>Fixed a bug that prevented the right-click menu option for Copy from working when the
        text was selected right-to-left instead of left-to-right or by double-clicking on a
        word.
    </li>
    <li>The Close menu option of the Current Group tab is now disabled.</li>
    <li>The Devil and Angel emoticons have been returned, but this time without animations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.85 - January 24, 2003</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added the ability to click and right-click on a user's nick name. Clicking on the
        nick will add it to your input window, and right-clicking gives you several options.
    </li>
    <li>Fixed a bug that prevented IcyBee from running on non 1.4 Java environments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.84 - January 24, 2003</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added a <i><b>URL Grabber</b></i> window that shows all URLs that have been received.
        URLs are organized into a tree by host name so they are easier to find. The window's
        visibility can be toggled from the <i><b>View</b></i> menu.
    </li>
    <li>Fixed a bug that caused the application to resize whenever the Look & Feel was changed.</li>
    <li>Added support to display timestamps for each message received. A variety of timestamp
        formats are supported.
    </li>
    <li>Improved the layout and format of the preferences dialog.</li>
    <li>Added the ability to toggle the network keep alive feature. When enabled, the time period
        between keep alive messages can be configured. The default is 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Enhanced text encoding property configuration to allow more choices than just UTF7.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug that caused the toolbar and statusbar visibility to not be saved when the user
        changed them.
    </li>
    <li>Words beginning with <i>www.</i> are now assumed to be URLs.</li>
    <li>The idle and connected time in the statusbar are now displayed with a smaller format
        that does not include seconds.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.83 - January 12, 2003</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added ability to change the application Look & Feel on the fly. Instead
        of being forced to use the standard Java Metal L&F, you can choose a native
        or other L&F.
    </li>
    <li>Removed animated emoticons and limited current emoticons to just :) :D :P ;) and :(.</li>
    <li>The tab history will now activate if text has been input without a command. This allows
        you to begin typing a message and activate the tab history without having to move the
        cursor back to the beginning of the message.
    </li>
    <li>The focus of the application should now be restored to the currently selected input window,
        even if that window isn't the primary group window.
    </li>
    <li>If the emoticon toolbar is used, the input focus is now returned to the proper input window.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug with the personal panels showing unformatted garbage text in the first line of
        the panel.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.82 - January 9, 2003</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added a right-click popup context menu for the output panel with
        Copy and Select All options.
    </li>
    <li>Added underlining of detected URLs in the output. In a future version,
        this will be a configurable text style.
    </li>
    <li>Changed emoticons so that if the output containing an emoticon is
        selected and then copied, the ASCII text for the emoticon is copied
        into the clipboard buffer.
    </li>
    <li>Changed the split between the output and input panels to be a user
        configurable split bar that allows resizing of the input window.
    </li>
    <li>An Emoticons toolbar menu was added that provides a list of current
        emoticons and their text equivalents.
    </li>
    <li>Added new emoticons: :spam:, :driving:, and :rolleyes:.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.81 - January 9, 2003</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added resume of autoscrolling if the user moves the scrollback
        back to the end position.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>What's New</i> page is now non-modal, so other client
        activity can continue when it is displayed.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.80 - January 9, 2003</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Scroll back finallly works as it should. You can safely select text
        in the buffer without having the selection disappear if new data is
        added to the output panel. Control-P still toggles the scroll lock,
        but now the scroll will automatically lock if the user moves the
        scroll slider back into the buffer.
    <li>Animated emoticons should no longer consume excessive CPU and should
        consume almost none when no longer on screen.
    </li>
    <li>Animated emoticons can now be disabled separately from normal static
        emoticons.
    </li>
    <li>The <i>What's New</i> page is now available from the Help menu.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.79 - January 6, 2003</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added new emoticons for :D, :-D, ]:), ]:-), 3:), 3:-). Changed >:) and >:-) to be }:) and }:-).
    <li>Enabled support for Java Run-Time Environment 1.3 for users with
        older environments. User's are <b>STRONGLY</b> encouraged to upgrade
        to 1.4.1 as soon as possible for better performance and bug fixes.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.78 - January 5, 2003</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug where sending text in a personal message panel would not go to the
        specified user (bug added in 0.77).
    </li>
    <li>Added support for existing emoticons to work if a nose is specified, too, i.e. :) and :-) will both work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.77 - January 5, 2003</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The command prefix character can now be configured. See the <i>Scripting</i> tab
        of the <i>Properties</i> dialog for more information.
    </li>
    <li>The tab for the current group will now display the actual group name.</li>
    <li>Graphical Emoticons are now supported by default for the following ASCII smilies: :), ;), :P, >:), O:), and :U.
        This option can be toggled from the <i>Text</i> tab of the <i>Properties</i> dialog.
    </li>
    <li>User tab history has been changed to work with all commands, not just personal messages.</li>
    <li>Pausing of the scrollback buffer has been changed so that the Control-P key sequence will pause
        the output. The status bar will also indicate if the output is currently scroll locked or not.
    </li>
    <li>The focus of the application will now default to the primary input window whenever the application
        is launched. It should also return to the input window whenever the application is activated (i.e. switched
        to or restored).
    </li>
</ul>
